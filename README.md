Qualtrics-Javascript-Codes

This is a wiki I will use to record important information (e.g. ideas, instructions, code) for use on Qualtrics. Mostly, this will be information which may assist with the implementation of the Q methodology in Qualtrics. You can access the wiki [here](https://github.com/AndreottaM/Qualtrics-Javascript-Codes/wiki)
